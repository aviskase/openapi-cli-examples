# About

[Stargate Network](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Stargate_Network) consists of points in space identifiable via special addresses. When you dial an address (like a phone number), a wormhole is established between your gate and a gate at the address. Gates are physical objects, so they can be destroyed or moved to another address.
